# USQ Flexi-format (open sourced edition)

This course format is a hybrid of the normal Weeks and Topics formats, allowing you to choose between them per section in your course. It also adds auxiliary "Getting started" and "Assessment" section types.

USQ provides this plugin in the hope that it is useful, but does not offer support for it.
